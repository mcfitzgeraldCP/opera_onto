# TKT-009 Fix: Property Definition Counts and Usage Tracking

## Issue Description
The property tracking mechanism showed significant inconsistencies:
- After TBox definition, the log incorrectly reported 0 object properties, 0 data properties
- Initial property usage report showed 0% access and 0% usage despite properties being set
- The final property usage report showed much higher usage, suggesting PopulationContext tracking was not updated correctly during the main population loops

## Root Causes
1. Property counting in `define_ontology_structure` was using incorrect type checking
2. Property usage tracking in `PopulationContext` was not correctly updated during `get_prop` and `set_prop` calls
3. `_set_property_value` was incrementing usage counters even when values weren't actually changed
4. The PopulationContext was not consistently passed through the entire processing chain
5. Property usage reports were not generated at appropriate steps in the process

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Property Counting in Structure Definition

In `ontology_generator/definition/structure.py`:
- Improved property type detection to correctly identify ObjectProperty and DataProperty types
- Fixed the property count logging to correctly report object and data property counts

```python
# TKT-009: Fix - Correctly count and log object properties and data properties
object_props = []
data_props = []
for prop_name, prop_obj in defined_properties.items():
    if isinstance(prop_obj, ObjectProperty) or (hasattr(prop_obj, 'is_a') and any(issubclass(p, ObjectProperty) for p in prop_obj.is_a)):
        object_props.append(prop_name)
    elif isinstance(prop_obj, DataProperty) or (hasattr(prop_obj, 'is_a') and any(issubclass(p, DataProperty) for p in prop_obj.is_a)):
        data_props.append(prop_name)
        
logger.info(f"TKT-009: Defined {len(defined_properties)} total properties ({len(object_props)} object properties, {len(data_props)} data properties)")
```

### 2. Fixed Property Usage Tracking in PopulationContext

In `ontology_generator/population/core.py`:
- Updated `get_prop` to track access counts only for defined properties
- Modified `set_prop` to defer tracking usage counts to `_set_property_value`
- Fixed `_set_property_value` to increment usage counters only when values are actually set

```python
# In get_prop
if name in self.defined_properties:
    self._property_access_count[name] = self._property_access_count.get(name, 0) + 1

# In _set_property_value
value_was_set = False  # Track if we actually set a value
# ... (setting logic)
if value_was_set and context is not None and hasattr(context, '_property_usage_count'):
    context._property_usage_count[original_prop_name] = context._property_usage_count.get(original_prop_name, 0) + 1
```

### 3. Improved Context Passing in Main Flow

In `ontology_generator/main.py`:
- Updated `populate_ontology_from_data` function to correctly return the PopulationContext
- Modified `_populate_abox` to log property usage report after initial population
- Fixed `_setup_sequence_relationships` and `_link_equipment_events` to accept and use a population_context parameter
- Added property usage report logging after each major processing step

### 4. Updated Dependent Modules

- Updated `sequence.py` and `linking.py` to accept and use the population_context parameter
- Fixed sequence.py to properly use the provided context for property tracking

## Expected Outcome

After these changes:
1. The TBox definition log will correctly report the counts of Object and Data properties defined
2. Property usage tracking will accurately reflect properties accessed and set during all population phases
3. Property usage reports will be generated at key points in the process, showing the progressive property usage

These fixes ensure that the application correctly tracks property definition and usage across all phases of ontology generation and population.
