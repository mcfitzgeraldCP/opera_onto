# TKT-010 Implementation Summary - Fixing isPartOfProductionLine Population

## Issue
The structural relationship `isPartOfProductionLine` was not being populated correctly. The property was defined in the CSV specification with a Target Link Context of "ProductionLine" rather than with a column name, but the post-processing code only checked for column mappings.

## Root Cause
1. The `process_structural_relationships` function in `row_processor.py` only checked for a column mapping for `isPartOfProductionLine`, not the Target Link Context.
2. There was also a need to properly populate the `associatedLineId` property for Equipment, which helps establish the link to ProductionLine.

## Implementation
The fix has two components:

### 1. Enhanced post-processing for structural relationships
- Modified `process_structural_relationships` to check both for a column mapping and a target_link_context mapping for `isPartOfProductionLine`
- When context is specified, it performs context-based linking by:
  - Looking for Equipment's associatedLineId property and matching it with Line IDs
  - Checking for LINE_NAME in stored equipment data
  - Creating bidirectional links (Equipment.isPartOfProductionLine â†” ProductionLine.hasEquipmentPart)
  - Tracking and logging linking statistics

### 2. Improved associatedLineId property population
- Added code in `equipment.py` to consistently set the `associatedLineId` property on Equipment during Pass 1
- Used either:
  - The ProductionLine's lineId value (preferred)
  - The LINE_NAME column value (fallback)
- This ensures Equipment has the necessary data for post-processing to establish the proper link to ProductionLine

## Benefits
1. Proper implementation of Target Link Context mechanism for structural properties
2. Enables context-based linking for isPartOfProductionLine, matching the CSV specification
3. Establishes the foundation for reliable Equipment-ProductionLine structural relationships
4. Better log information for tracking and debugging linking issues
