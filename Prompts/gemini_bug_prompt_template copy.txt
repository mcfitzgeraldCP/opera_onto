Boilerplate direction - applicable to all prompts
=================================================


Review the issues in the log file and create a prioritized list of fix and improvement tickets using the ticket template.
Consider the ontology_generator source code and also the ontology specification as both might have issues that inter relate.
Tickets should indicate request of unit test if critically required, be judicious 

IMPORTANT - Ask clarifying questions and for supporting information like documentation for third party libraries, etc.




==============
Ticket template
==============
there is an markdown template to follow, note that it has a separate directions doc and a guide for version bumping


=================================
You have the following resources:
=================================
Example, there could be more

- The log with error messages
- The ontology specification (csv) used to generate the OWL 
- The actual raw data (csv) used 
- The ontology generator source code - note that all comments and docstrings were stripped to save space

Do you understand?
