There is important data missing from the ontology based on a review of the raw data and after some queries failed.
Explain why these are missing and if it was a mistake, how we add them back in.

Please ensure all of these raw data are represented in the ontology:

AE_MODEL_CATEGORY	TOTAL_TIME_SECONDS	TOTAL_TIME	BUSINESS_EXTERNAL_TIME	PLANT_AVAILABLE_TIME	EFFECTIVE_RUNTIME	PLANT_DECISION_TIME	PRODUCTION_AVAILABLE_TIME	GOOD_PRODUCTION_QTY	REJECT_PRODUCTION_QTY	DOWNTIME	RUN_TIME	NOT_ENTERED	WAITING_TIME	PLANT_EXPERIMENTATION	ALL_MAINTENANCE	AUTONOMOUS_MAINTENANCE	PLANNED_MAINTENANCE

We need this data to do analysis in the context of the asset effectiveness model - somtimes known as operational equipment effectivenesss

========================
Asset Effectivness Model
========================

The Asset Effectiveness Model is a framework used to analyze and improve the productivity of equipment and manufacturing processes. It works by breaking down the total available time for an asset (e.g. a piece of equipment on a production line) and identifying the various factors that reduce the amount of time the asset is actually producing effectively.   

The model starts with the concept of "Total Available Time," which is the maximum amount of time an asset could potentially operate (e.g., 24 hours a day, 365 days a year). From this starting point, the model systematically accounts for different categories of time loss:   

ALL TIMES ARE REPORTED IN MINUTES

Business External Time: This is time lost due to factors outside the control of the plant or production operations.   
Plant Decision Time: This represents time when the plant is not scheduled to run due to management decisions, such as planned shutdowns or lack of orders. Subtracting these losses results in "Plant Available Time".   
Production Available Time: Further time reductions occur due to factors like maintenance, process issues or material shortages.
Unplanned Down Time: This is time lost due to unexpected events like equipment breakdowns or unscheduled maintenance. After accounting for downtime, we arrive at "Run Time".   
Run Time Losses: Even during run time, there can be inefficiencies that reduce effective production, such as slow cycles or reduced yield.   
The ultimate goal is to arrive at "Effective Run Time," which is the time the asset is actually producing good quality output at full capacity.   

To quantify and analyze these time losses, the Asset Effectiveness Model uses several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):   

Asset Utilization (AU): This is a global metric that measures the percentage of Plant Available Time that is Effective Runtime. It's calculated as (Effective Runtime / Plant Available Time) x 100. AU is often used to set productivity improvement goals and is typically reported monthly.   
Operating Efficiency (OE): This KPI represents how well the operation performed when production wanted the equipment to run. It's calculated as (Effective Runtime / Production Available Time) x 100. OE helps diagnose issues related to maintenance, process, materials, or labor.   
Runtime Efficiency (RE): This measures how well the equipment performed specifically during the time it was supposed to be running. It's calculated as (Effective Runtime / Runtime) x 100. RE helps monitor trends in line throughput and quality.   
Asset Effectiveness (AE): Calculated as (Effective Runtime / Total Available Time) x 100. This metric is monitored over longer periods but is less commonly used than Asset Utilization.   
In essence, the Asset Effectiveness Model provides a structured way to understand where production time is being lost, enabling targeted improvement efforts to maximize asset productivity.
